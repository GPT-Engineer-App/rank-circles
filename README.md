# rank-circles

A rank component. First column/section shows a series of circles (like avatars) each circle is a node with a value - nodes are arranged in descending order according to their value. When a node is clicked an 'active' state is toggled. When activate, form to increase or decrease the node's value is shown. When a nodes value is changed the circles must re-arrange their order. *IMPORTANT* nodes' values are periodically randomized to demonstrate the re-arrangement / shuffle animation. The next column/section shows information about the nodes, their labels, and values.
